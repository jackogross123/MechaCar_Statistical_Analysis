# MechaCar Statistical Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

AutosRUsâ€™the MechaCar, the newest prototype, is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team's progress. By running regression analyses and t-tests, I will review production data for  the MechaCar and provide insights that may help the manufacturing team. Additionally, I will design a statistical study to study the MechCar against other top manufactured cars.

### Analysis Resources
* **Data Sources:** [MechaCar_mpg.csv](https://github.com/jackogross123/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/MechaCar_mpg.csv)
* **Software:** R, RStudio
 
## Deliverable 1 - Linear regression to predict Miles per Gallon

Our linear regression model uses the inputs:

mpg = (6.267)vehicle_length + (0.0012)vehicle_weight + (0.0688)spoiler_angle + (3.546)ground_clearance + (-3.411)AWD - 104.0

- The vechicle lengths, weights, angle, and ground clearance are likely to produce an MPG that is not random.
- A 70% r squared tells us that only 30% of the regression can not be explained by the model
- The p value tells us that there is statistical significance from our findings.

## Deliverable 4 - Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition


**H0 (Null Hypothesis):** MechaCar's vehicle safety ratings are no different from its competitors 

**Ha (Alternative Hypothesis):** MechaCar's vehicle safety ratings are different from its competitors
